## BML_projects_Instructions

This is a repo providing instructions for BML class projects, designed by Shang Zhu

# Project Idea 1: Inverse Design for Airfoils 
We are trying to build ML surrogate for airfoil performance prediction, and create a generative model for airfoil images (GAN, VAE, Diffusion Models)

# Project Idea 2: NeuralECM
We are trying to fit equivalent circuit models with eVTOL discharging datasets, inside a differentiable framework (torchdiffeq, julia)

julia implementation of neuralECM can be found here: https://github.com/abillscmu/NeuralECM.jl
